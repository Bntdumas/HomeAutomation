Home Automation
=============

Home automation is cool.
The thing is, it is also very expensive to buy ready-made modules. Especially if you want to automate large parts of your house.

The good news is that you can find everything you need to create your own home ayutomation system for cheap on internet,
if you don't mind putting a bit of work into it.

This is what motivates me to create my own home automatisation system.

The design goes roughly like this:
- All the house data is stored in a Qt application, running on a computer used as a server.
- Every client communicates via TCP sockets to the server, a client being an user interface or a hardware module.
- The main application hosts a TCP server that communicates both ways with the hardware modules via wifi (using the inexpensive ESP8266 modules from EspressIf)
- The TCP frames are text based, using XML for easy parsing.
