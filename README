Home Automation
=============

Home automation is cool.
The thing is, it is also very expensive to buy ready-made modules. Especially if you want to automate large parts of your house.

The good news is that you can find everything you need to create your own home ayutomation system for cheap on internet,
if you don't mind putting a bit of work into it.

This is what motivates me to create my own home automatisation system.

The design goes like this:
- All the house data is stored in a postgres database.
- The main application hosts a TCP server that communicates both ways with the hardware modules via wifi (using the inexpensive ESP8266 modules from EspressIf)
- This main application then writes data to the database.
- Each client can connect to the database and get/write data on it
